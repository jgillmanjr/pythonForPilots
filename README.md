pythonForPilots
===============

## Wot?
I thought I'd try my hand at writing a series of lessons about Python geared towards pilots.

Nothing too fancy.

## About the Author
Well, I'm no one special really.

I've been working in the data space for a few years now.

While I use python a decent amount, both personally and professionally, I certainly wouldn't say that I'm an expert. If you see something I messed up in this series, please let me know or feel free to make a pull request.

I also happen to be a pilot. I currently have my P/ASEL and instrument ratings.

Given I have some previous experience ground handling for a 121 operator (and quite a few friends flying 121), don't be surprised if I end up taking some of that context and applying it to this project.

## Goal
As mentioned, I won't proclaim to be an expert with python. Given what I currently use it for, and how I've learned the language (basically, dumpster diving docs and Google for specific answers), there's a chance that I might not include something that someone might think "needed" for an introduction. If you identify such a thing, please don't hesitate to let me know.

Basically, I'm looking at building an introduction to the language using examples that other pilots might find interesting or even useful.

## Updates / Additions
As I get feedback or realize the error of my ways, I'll try to update lessons as appropriate.

Of course, as I think of more things that might be interesting and appropriate, I'll try and add additional lessons.

I hope someone gets some benefit out of this.
