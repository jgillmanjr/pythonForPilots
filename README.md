pythonForPilots
===============

## Wot?
I thought I'd try my hand at writing a series of lessons about Python geared towards pilots.

Nothing too fancy.

## About the Author
Well, I'm no one special really.

I'm currently a Business Intelligence engineer for a web hosting company in Michigan.

While I use python a decent amount in the course of my job, I certainly wouldn't say that I'm an expert. If you see something I messed up in this series, please let me know or feel free to make a pull request.

But of course I also happen to be a pilot. I currently have my P/ASEL and should be knocking out my Instrument ride fairly soon.

I also have some previous experience ground handling for a 121 operator, so don't be surprised if I end up taking some of that context and applying it to this project.

## Goal
As mentioned, I won't proclaim to be an expert with python. Given what I currently use it for, and how I've learned the language (basically, dumpster diving docs and Google for specific answers), there's a chance that I might not include something that someone might think "needed" for an introduction. If you identify such a thing, please don't hesitate to let me know.

Basically, I'm looking at building an introduction to the language using examples that other pilots might find interesting or even useful.

## Layout / Format
For some lessons, such as [Lesson 0](lesson_0.md), will be in markdown format, but most will probably be in Jupyter Notebook format (*.ipynb).

Regardless of the format, the lesson will be the portion before the prefix.
